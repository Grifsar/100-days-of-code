# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 25, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Just some Javascript practice involving an array of objects and printing it out to the page. I'll likely use this to practice other array methods. I put in very basic CSS even though that's NOT The point of this

**Thoughts:** I honestly wish I was faster at this, but I've never had a JS heavy job before and haven't so I haven't used it on a consistent basis so I'm trying to cut myself some slack. If I need a break from the JS, I may add better styles to some point or introduce something like Tailwind to the project.
