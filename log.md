# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 25, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Just some Javascript practice involving an array of objects and printing it out to the page. I'll likely use this to practice other array methods. I put in very basic CSS even though that's NOT The point of this

**Thoughts:** I honestly wish I was faster at this, but I've never had a JS heavy job before and haven't so I haven't used it on a consistent basis so I'm trying to cut myself some slack. If I need a break from the JS, I may add better styles to some point or introduce something like Tailwind to the project.

### Day 2: June 26, 2022


**Today's Progress**: More Javascript practice - this time focusing on adding event listeners, working with custom data, and basic sorting.

**Thoughts:** A couple of these things I'm practicing tripped me up on an assessment I took not that long ago so I've been meaning to practice these more for a while now

### Day 3: June 27, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Started a second project for practicing with APIs. The first project is done unless I decide to go back and style it

**Thoughts:** I'm into astronomy so the Nasa apis seemed like a good one to work with. I'll admit it feels a little put the api key in the repo like this. I may need refresh myself on the best ways to protect an api in javascript. It was also good to get practice with using the `${js code here}` syntax as that was introduced after I first learned web development

### Day 4: June 28, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Added a date picker and set a range to it for the photo of the day function. I also started working on a random date function

**Thoughts:** Adding the date picker went fairly smoothly, but the random date function is taking a little bit longer. I do think it's a good exercise in working with dates, especially because I'm trying to limit it to the same range as the date picker to avoid invalid images
