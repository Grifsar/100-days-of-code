# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: June 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Just some Javascript practice involving an array of objects and printing it out to the page. I'll likely use this to practice other array methods. I put in very basic CSS even though that's NOT The point of this

**Thoughts:** I honestly wish I was faster at this, but I've never had a JS heavy job before and haven't so I haven't used it on a consistent basis so I'm trying to cut myself some slack. If I need a break from the JS, I may add better styles to some point or introduce something like Tailwind to the project.

### Day 2: June 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More Javascript practice - this time focusing on adding event listeners, working with custom data, and basic sorting.

**Thoughts:** A couple of these things I'm practicing tripped me up on an assessment I took not that long ago so I've been meaning to practice these more for a while now

### Day 3: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started a second project for practicing with APIs. The first project is done unless I decide to go back and style it

**Thoughts:** I'm into astronomy so the Nasa apis seemed like a good one to work with. I'll admit it feels a little put the api key in the repo like this. I may need refresh myself on the best ways to protect an api in javascript. It was also good to get practice with using the `${js code here}` syntax as that was introduced after I first learned web development

### Day 4: June 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added a date picker and set a range to it for the photo of the day function. I also started working on a random date function

**Thoughts:** Adding the date picker went fairly smoothly, but the random date function is taking a little bit longer. I do think it's a good exercise in working with dates, especially because I'm trying to limit it to the same range as the date picker to avoid invalid images

### Day 5: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the random function and added a button to the page to call it. I still need to add some error handling for the response codes

**Thoughts:** It didn't take too long to get the random function up and running - I actually thought of a way to do it shortly after I stepped away from this project yesterday. I need to look into how to handle responses from the REST api for when I make a bad request. Pretty sure I've done this before, but it's been a while.

### Day 6: June 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Some light error handling, mostly just giving the user a message when something goes wrong. I also added more comments and styles. 

**Thoughts:** I was feeling kind of down today and so I ended up focusing more on adding a little bit more styles and comments. I need to figure out what I want to do for the next project. I think I need a bit more practice before I switch over to practicing with one of the major JS frameworks. I also need to decide with framework to focus on as I'm a bit more familiar with Angular, but I get the feeling that there are more React jobs out there.

### Day 7: July 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Just some string review and practice

**Thoughts:** I'm starting think that one of the harder parts of this challenge is going to be picking projects to do for it. There are, obviously, lots of options out there. My main goal with this is to work more with Javascript so I don't actually feel too bad about how today went

### Day 8: July 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Started on a project to practice React with

**Thoughts:** I decided to try to redo my Nasa photo of the day project as a React app. React is something that I've taken tutorials on, but haven't done a project on my own with just yet so this seems like a good practice project for me. I also decided to try out Tailwind CSS while I was at it because I've crash coursed it before but haven't used in a project proper.

I did miss a few days as between being unemployed and the general state of the world my mental health hasn't bee the best, but I'm back to continue this project.

### Day 9: July 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Got some hooks working the Nasaphoto app, app now loads photo on load and the date picker now pulls in a new photo when you hit enter

**Thoughts:** I still have a little ways to go before this has all the functions of the original version, and there are some extra features that I want add as well. I think I'll be able to get the rest of the original features in during tomorrow's 1 hour session. I think this has been a good exercise thus far. I may dedicate more than an to this tomorrow and get a bit more serious about the styles.

### Day 10: July 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Implemented random photo and added more styles using Tailwind. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as far as I'd like to on the error handling in this. It looks like I'm going to need to dig a bit more into how conditionals work in React and may need to do some refactoring

### Day 11: July 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added error handling - started looking into deploying this to a subdirectory on Netlify

**Thoughts:** Figured out the issue with the if statement within minutes of starting to program today and it was just a syntax error. It looks like it's more common to use the drag and drop feature to deploy react apps to Netlify, but I have an existing site and I want to be able to have multiple react apps under the same domain but in different directories
